## This is the initial copy for this site. The name of the site is memymojo.

We will be using the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/spamaloid/memymojo/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for this website in Markdown files.

Whenever we commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in our Markdown files.
